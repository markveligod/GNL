# :white_check_mark: Get next line (GNL project 2020)
## TASK
Write an GNL `(get_next_line)` that reads line by line from the file descriptor.  
This function should not contain third-party libraries `(Libft)` and write all necessary additional functions in `get_next_line_utils.c`.
Calling your get_next_line function in a loop will allow you to read the text available in the file descriptor one line at a time until EOF.
